# QuickerCater

A flexible, WYSIWYG virtual store creator for anyone who wants to advertise their products online.

## Getting Started

Navigate to [QuickerCater](https://quickercater.herokuapp.com) and Login using your gmail account!

### Prerequisities

QuickerCater utilitizes the power of [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/download) to handle persistent data storage.  Navigate to the site and follow the instructions to start using it.

QuickerCater also utilitizes the power of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run the application locally during development.  We recommend downloading version 6.7.0 to enjoy the full power of this wonderful runtime.

### Installing

After installing Neo4j and Node, clone the source repository by typing

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rubber-duckies/the-frank-tank
```

into your terminal.  Navigate to the root folder of the project and type

```
npm install
```

After the dependencies finish installing, type

```
npm start
```

In your browser, navigate to localhost:3000.  Make sure that you have a Neo4j server running!
